# Gear-metrology-using-Computer-Vision
MATLAB Code for determining gear dimensions and type.
These are codes for
1) Capturing Gear Image, Segmenting the gear and camera caliberation
2) Doing necessary computation to detect Inner and Outer Diameter and hence average gear teeth size that gives error of less than 1.7 mm.
